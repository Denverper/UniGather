# DU Hackathon 2023

UniGather's mission is to empower students in their endeavors to create clubs that allow them to form meaningful connections with other peers.

This app was created for the DU hackathon competition 2023. The app allows for students to post their interests in clubs they want to see created. If ten students show interest or "like" an idea, meeting university participation requirements, the app allows faculty users to sign on and "create" the club at the press of a button, as all clubs need a faculty sponsor, moving the newly formed club to the club section rather than the idea section. Once a club exists, all members will see the club under "myClubs," and they will be able to join clubs they are not in by "liking" a club in all clubs. Once a club exists, members of the club can make posts under the club section. The home page of the application consists of a feed of posts by any club.

In future developments, we plan to include data verification, email verification, posts with images, and more, smaller improvements and features.

For this competition, we decided to use Flutter, a mobile app framework, for multi-platform availability and ease of integration with Firebase.
